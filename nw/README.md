## Hive / Node-Webkit

This sub-project of the Hive AI Development tool was mainly written as a system integration test visualizer.
It allows a human player to interact with and test their AI via a TCP socket; it also is intended for
recorded game-playback during automated round-robin tournaments, and output visualization.
