There is no need to hand-edit the .hive-cli-registry directly. It is typically managed via hive-cli commands.
But if you should need to, there's an example packaged with this readme.

Note on  registry.ai_modules.local[0..n]:
path is relative to the location of the hive-cli.js script (aka: self-path), and points to a directory containing a package.json file.
