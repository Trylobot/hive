## Hive / Node-Webkit

This sub-project of the Hive AI Development tool was mainly written as a system integration test visualizer.
It allows a human player to interact with and test their AI via a TCP socket; it also is intended for
recorded game-playback during automated round-robin tournaments, and output visualization.

To run it, install NW.js (formerly "Node Webkit"); then, from the command line run `nwjs .` (assuming cwd is this directory)
For example, on MacOS X this looks like: 
  /Applications/nwjs.app/Contents/MacOS/nwjs .
