## Hive / Web

This is a discontinued sub-project of the Hive AI Development Tool; it may be picked up again
at some date in the future, but for now it remains mostly incomplete.

It was originally intended to implement the various Hive AI Development Tool interfaces
while being served up to the WWW and providing AI functionality via web workers, and multiplayer
via web sockets. I didn't want to mess with hosting and stuff though, so for now I've left it unfinished.
