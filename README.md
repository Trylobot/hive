Hive AI Development Tool
====

API documentation forthcoming. Support is planned for AI written in any language; communication will be asynchronous and be driven by the server; AI modules will serve as plugins and be responsible for replying to requests from the server, after an initial handshake. Communication will be performed via ZeroMQ.
